\title{Graph fitted stratified survival curves from Cox Proportional Hazards models}
\usage{
ggfitStrata(
  obj,
  byStrata = FALSE,
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "",
  title = "",
  lcolour = "#2C7FB8",
  rcolour = "#2C7FB8"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{survfit} object.}

\item{byStrata}{logical, whether or not you want to include all of the
stratified survival curves on one plot or separate them into a grid arranged
plot.}

\item{xlab}{a label for the plot's x-axis}

\item{ylab}{a label of the plot's y-axis}

\item{title}{plot title.}

\item{lcolour}{line color. Currently only works if \code{byStrata = TRUE}.
The default it \code{lcolour = "#2C7FB8"} (a bluish hexadecimal colour)}

\item{rcolour}{confidence bounds ribbon color. Either a single color or a
vector of colours. The default it \code{lcolour = "#2C7FB8"}
(a bluish hexadecimal colour)}
}
\description{
This function largely improves \code{\link{plot.survfit}}. It
plots the curves using ggplot2 rather than base R graphics. One major
advantage is the ability to split the survival curves into multiple plots and
arrange them in a grid. This makes it easier to examine many strata at once.
Otherwise they can be very bunched up.

Note: the strata legend labels need to be changed manually (see
\code{revalue}) in the \code{survfit} object with the \code{strata}
component.
}
\details{
\code{ggfitStrata} graphs fitted survival curves created with
\code{\link{survfit}} using ggplot2.

# Load packages
library(survival)
library(simPH)

# Subset data
bladder1 <- bladder[bladder$enum < 5, ]

# Estimate coxph model (note that this model is for code illustration only)
M1 <- coxph(Surv(stop, event) ~ (rx + size + number) + strata(enum) +
                cluster(id), bladder1)

# Find predicted values
M1Fit <- survfit(M1)

# Plot strata in a grid
ggfitStrata(M1Fit, byStrata = TRUE)

# Plot all in one
ggfitStrata(M1Fit, byStrata = FALSE)
