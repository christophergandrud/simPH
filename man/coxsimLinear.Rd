\title{Simulate quantities of interest for covariates from Cox Proportional Hazards
models that are not interacted with time or nonlinearly transformed}
\usage{
coxsimLinear(
  obj,
  b,
  qi = "Relative Hazard",
  Xj = NULL,
  Xl = NULL,
  means = FALSE,
  nsim = 1000,
  ci = 0.95,
  spin = FALSE,
  extremesDrop = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{\link{coxph}} class fitted model object.}

\item{b}{character string name of the coefficient you would like to simulate.}

\item{qi}{quantity of interest to simulate. Values can be
\code{"Relative Hazard"}, \code{"First Difference"}, \code{"Hazard Ratio"},
and \code{"Hazard Rate"}. The default is \code{qi = "Relative Hazard"}. If
\code{qi = "Hazard Rate"} and the \code{coxph} model has strata, then hazard
rates for each strata will also be calculated.}

\item{Xj}{numeric vector of fitted values for \code{b} to simulate for.}

\item{Xl}{numeric vector of values to compare \code{Xj} to. Note if
\code{code = "Relative Hazard"} only \code{Xj} is relevant.}

\item{means}{logical, whether or not to use the mean values to fit the
hazard rate for covaraiates other than \code{b}. Note: EXPERIMENTAL.
\code{lines} are not currently supported in \code{\link{simGG}} if
\code{means = TRUE}.}

\item{nsim}{the number of simulations to run per value of X. Default is
\code{nsim = 1000}. Note: it does not currently support models that include
polynomials created by \code{\link{I}}.}

\item{ci}{the proportion of simulations to keep. The default is
\code{ci = 0.95}, i.e. keep the middle 95 percent. If \code{spin = TRUE}
then \code{ci} is the confidence level of the shortest probability interval.
Any value from 0 through 1 may be used.}

\item{spin}{logical, whether or not to keep only the shortest probability
interval rather than the middle simulations. Currently not supported for
Hazard Rates.}

\item{extremesDrop}{logical whether or not to drop simulated quantity of
interest values that are \code{Inf}, \code{NA}, \code{NaN} and
\eqn{> 1000000} for \code{spin = FALSE} or \eqn{> 800} for
\code{spin = TRUE}. These values are difficult to plot \code{\link{simGG}}
and may prevent \code{spin} from finding the central interval.}

\description{
Simulates relative hazards, first differences, hazard ratios,
and hazard rates for linear, non-time interacted covariates from Cox
Proportional Hazard models. These can be plotted with \code{\link{simGG}}.
}
\details{
\code{coxsimLinear} simulates relative hazards, first differences, and
hazard ratios for linear covariates that are not interacted with time or
nonlinearly transformed from models estimated with \code{\link{coxph}} using
the multivariate normal distribution. These can be plotted with
\code{\link{simGG}}.
