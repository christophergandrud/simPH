\usage{
coxsimSpline(obj, bspline, bdata, qi = "Relative Hazard", Xj = 1, Xl = 0,
  nsim = 1000, ci = 0.95, spin = FALSE, extremesDrop = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{\link{coxph}} class fitted model object with a penalized
spline. These can be plotted with \code{\link{simGG}}.}

\item{bspline}{a character string of the full \code{\link{pspline}} call
used in \code{obj}. It should be exactly the same as how you entered it in
\code{\link{coxph}}. You also need to enter a white spece before and after
all equal (\code{=}) signs.}

\item{bdata}{a numeric vector of splined variable's values.}

\item{qi}{quantity of interest to simulate. Values can be
\code{"Relative Hazard"}, \code{"First Difference"}, \code{"Hazard Ratio"},
and \code{"Hazard Rate"}. The default is \code{qi = "Relative Hazard"}.
Think carefully before using \code{qi = "Hazard Rate"}. You may be creating
very many simulated values which can be very computationally intensive to do.
Adjust the number of simulations per fitted value with \code{nsim}.}

\item{Xj}{numeric vector of fitted values for \code{b} to simulate for.}

\item{Xl}{numeric vector of values to compare \code{Xj} to. Note if
\code{qi = "Relative Hazard"} or \code{"Hazard Rate"} only \code{Xj} is
relevant.}

\item{nsim}{the number of simulations to run per value of \code{Xj}. Default
is \code{nsim = 1000}.}

\item{ci}{the proportion of simulations to keep. The default is
\code{ci = 0.95}, i.e. keep the middle 95 percent. If \code{spin = TRUE}
then \code{ci} is the confidence level of the shortest probability interval.
Any value from 0 through 1 may be used.}

\item{spin}{logical, whether or not to keep only the shortest probability
interval rather than the middle simulations. Currently not supported for
hazard rates.}

\item{extremesDrop}{logical whether or not to drop simulated quantity of
interest values that are \code{Inf}, \code{NA}, \code{NaN} and
\eqn{> 1000000} for \code{spin = FALSE} or \eqn{> 800} for \code{spin = TRUE}.
These values are difficult to plot \code{\link{simGG}} and may prevent
\code{spin} from finding the central interval.}

\code{coxsimSpline} simulates quantities of interest from penalized splines

\details{
Simulates relative hazards, first differences, hazard ratios, and
hazard rates for penalized splines from Cox Proportional Hazards models.
These can be plotted with \code{\link{simGG}}.
A Cox PH model with one penalized spline is given by:
 \deqn{h(t|\mathbf{X}_{i})=h_{0}(t)\mathrm{e}^{g(x)}}{h(t|X[i])=h[0](t)exp(g
(x))}

where \eqn{g(x)} is the penalized spline function. For our post-estimation
purposes \eqn{g(x)} is basically a series of linearly combined coefficients
such that:

 \deqn{g(x) = \beta_{k_{1}}(x)_{1+} + \beta_{k_{2}}(x)_{2+} + \beta_{k_{3}}(x)_{3+} + \ldots + \beta_{k_{n}}(x)_{n+}}{g(x) = \beta[k][1](x)[1+] + \beta[k][2](x)[2+] + \beta[k][3](x)[3+] + \ldots + \beta[k][n](x)[n+]}

where \eqn{k} are the equally spaced spline knots with values inside of the
range of observed \eqn{x} and \eqn{n} is the number of knots.

We can again draw values of each \eqn{\beta_{k_{1}},\: \ldots \beta_{k_{n}}}{\beta[k][1], \ldots \beta[k[n]}
from the multivariate normal distribution
described above. We then use these simulated coefficients to estimates
quantities of interest for a range covariate values. For example, the first
difference between two values \eqn{x_{j}}{x[j]} and \eqn{x_{l}}{x[l]} is:

   \deqn{\%\triangle h_{i}(t) = (\mathrm{e}^{g(x_{j}) - g(x_{l})} - 1) * 100}
{FD(h[i](t)) = (exp(g(x[j]) - g(x[l])) - 1) * 100}

Relative hazards and hazard ratios can be calculated by extension.

Currently \code{coxsimSpline} does not support simulating hazard rates form
multiple stratified models.
