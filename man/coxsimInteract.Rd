\usage{
coxsimInteract(
  obj,
  b1,
  b2,
  qi = "Marginal Effect",
  X1 = NULL,
  X2 = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{\link{coxph}} class fitted model object with a linear
multiplicative interaction.}

\item{b1}{character string of the first constitutive variable's name.
Note \code{b1} and \code{b2} must be entered in the order in which they are
entered into the \code{coxph} model.}

\item{b2}{character string of the second constitutive variable's name.}

\item{qi}{quantity of interest to simulate. Values can be
\code{"Marginal Effect"}, \code{"First Difference"}, \code{"Hazard Ratio"},
and \code{"Hazard Rate"}. The default is \code{qi = "Hazard Ratio"}.
If \code{qi = "Hazard Rate"} and the \code{coxph} model has strata, then
hazard rates for each strata will also be calculated.}

\item{X1}{numeric vector of fitted values of \code{b1} to simulate for.
If \code{qi = "Marginal Effect"} then only \code{X2} can be set. If you want
to plot the results, \code{X1} should have more than one value.}

\item{X2}{numeric vector of fitted values of \code{b2} to simulate for.}

\item{means}{logical, whether or not to use the mean values to fit the
hazard rate for covaraiates other than \code{b1} \code{b2} and \code{b1*b2}.
Note: it does not currently support models that include polynomials created
by \code{\link{I}}. Note: EXPERIMENTAL. \code{lines} are not currently
supported in \code{\link{simGG}} if \code{means = TRUE}.}

\item{expMarg}{logical. Whether or not to exponentiate the marginal effect.}

\item{nsim}{the number of simulations to run per value of X. Default is
\code{nsim = 1000}.}

\item{ci}{the proportion of middle simulations to keep. The default is
\code{ci = 0.95}, i.e. keep the middle 95 percent. If \code{spin = TRUE}
then \code{ci} is the confidence level of the shortest probability interval.
Any value from 0 through 1 may be used.}

\item{spin}{logical, whether or not to keep only the shortest probability
interval rather than the middle simulations. Currently not supported for
hazard rates.}

\item{extremesDrop}{logical whether or not to drop simulated quantity of
interest values that are \code{Inf}, \code{NA}, \code{NaN} and
\eqn{> 1000000} for \code{spin = FALSE} or \eqn{> 800} for \code{spin = TRUE}.
These values are difficult to plot \code{\link{simGG}} and may prevent
\code{spin} from finding the central interval.}

\description{
\code{coxsimInteract} simulates quantities of interest for linear
multiplicative interactions using multivariate normal distributions.
These can be plotted with \code{\link{simGG}}.
}
\details{
Simulates marginal effects, first differences, hazard ratios, and
hazard rates for linear multiplicative interactions.
Marginal effects are calculated as in Brambor et al. (2006) with the
addition that we take the exponent, so that it resembles a hazard ratio.
You can choose not to take the exponent by setting the argument
\code{expMarg = FALSE}. For an interaction between variables \eqn{X} and
\eqn{Z} the marginal effect for \eqn{X} is:
\deqn{ME_{X} = e^(\beta_{X} + \beta_{XZ}Z)}{ME[X] = exp(\beta[X] +
\beta[XZ]Z)}

Note that for First Differences the comparison is not between two values of
the same variable but two values of the constitute variable and 0 for the
two variables.

# 'drugtreated'.
