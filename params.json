{"name":"simPH","tagline":"Tools for simulating and graphing results from proportional hazards survival models.","body":"simPH\r\n======\r\n\r\n### Christopher Gandrud\r\n\r\n### Version 0.04.6.2\r\n\r\n### Note: **simPH** is in beta. Please report any bugs at <https://github.com/christophergandrud/simPH/issues>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn R package for simulating and plotting quantities of interest (relative hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios)for linear coefficients, multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines, and non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survival curves from Cox Proportional Hazard models.\r\n\r\nFor more information plus examples, please see this [working paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2227226).\r\n\r\nThe package includes the following functions:\r\n\r\n#### Simulation Functions\r\n\r\n- `coxsimLinear`: Simulates relative hazards, first differences, hazard ratios, and hazard rates for linear time-constant covariates from Cox Proportional Hazard models.\r\n\r\n- `coxsimtvc`: a function for simulating time-varying hazards (relative hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) from a Cox PH model estimated using `coxph` from the [survival](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) package. For more information see this [blog post](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/10/graphing-non-proportional-hazards-in-r.html). The function will calculate time-varying hazard ratios for multiple strata estimated from a stratified Cox PH model.\r\n\r\n- `coxsimSpline`: a function for simulating quantities of interest from penalised splines using multivariate normal distributions. Currently does not support simulating hazard rates from stratified models. **Note:** be extremely careful about the number of simulations you ask the function to find. It is very easy to ask for more than your computer can handle.\r\n\r\n- `coxsimPoly`: a function for simulating polynomial relative hazards.\r\n\r\n- `coxsimInteract`: a function for simulating quantities of interest for linear multiplicative interactions, including marginal effects and hazard rates.\r\n\r\n#### Plotting Functions\r\n\r\n- `gglinear`: plots simulated linear time-constant hazards using [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/).\r\n\r\n- `ggtvc`: uses **ggplot2** to graph the simulated time-varying relative hazards, first differences, hazard ratios or stratified hazard rates.\r\n\r\n- `ggspline`: uses **ggplot2** and `scatter3d` (from the [car](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html) package) to plot quantities of interest from `simspline` objects, including relative hazards, first differences, hazard ratios, and hazard rates.\r\n\r\n- `ggpoly`: uses **ggplot2** to graph the simulated polynomial relative hazards.\r\n\r\n- `gginteract`: uses **ggplot2** to graph linear multiplicative interactions\r\n\r\n#### Misc.\r\n\r\n- `tvc`: a function for creating time interactions. Currently supports `'linear'`, natural `'log'`, and exponentiation (`'power'`).\r\n\r\n- `ggfitStrata`: a function to plot fitted stratified survival curves estimated from `survfit` using **ggplot2**. This function builds on the **survival** package's `plot.survfit` command. One major advantage is the ability to split the survival curves into multiple plots and arrange them in a grid. This makes it easier to examine many strata at once. Otherwise they can be very bunched up.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) command `install_github` to install **simPH** in R. Here is the exact code for installing version:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"simPH\", \"christophergandrud\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tip\r\n\r\nBefore running the simulation and graph commands in this package carefully consider how many simulations you are about to make. Especially for hazard rates over long periods of time and with multiple strata, you can be asking **simPH** to run very many simulations. This will be computationally intensive. \r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n\r\nFor more information about simulating parameter estimates to make interpretation of results easier see:\r\n\r\nLicht, Amanda A. 2011.

I intend to expand the quantities of interest that can be simulated and graphed for Cox PH models. I am also currently working on functions that can simulate and graph hazard ratios estimated from [Fine and Gray competing risks models](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2670170). \r\n\r\nI am also working on a way to graph hazard ratios with frailties. \r\n","google":"UA-985930-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
