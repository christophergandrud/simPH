Package: simPH
Title: Tools for simulating and plotting quantities of interest estimated from
    Cox Proportional Hazards models
Description: The package simulates and plots quantities of interest (relative
    hazards, first differences, and hazard ratios) for linear coefficients,
    multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines, and
    non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survival curves from Cox
    Proportional Hazard models. It also simulates and plots marginal effects
    for multiplicative interactions.
